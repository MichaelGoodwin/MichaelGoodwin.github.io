    <hr/>

    <p>RPDeath is a <a href="https://fivem.net" target="_blank">FiveM</a> script written in Lua that is used to enhance the role-playing experience of dead/hurt players. Enabling this script prevents automatic respawning and changes the respawn points to one of the 5 in-game hospitals.</p>
    
    <p>When a player dies their body will stay in place and a 5 timer starts after which the player can respawn/revive themselves. During this time another player can respawn/revive them, which is commonly used for Paramedic role-playing.</p>
